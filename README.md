 # Sustainable Urban Mobility – Agra

**Project:** Sustainable Mobility Case Study for CAIC Summer of Tech 2025

This project aims to design a tech-driven, low-emission urban mobility strategy for **Agra** by 2030–2040. Agra, a historical city with heavy tourist traffic, faces rising congestion, air pollution, and dependence on two-wheelers and informal transit modes.

### Key Goals

- Reduce CO₂ and PM₂.₅ emissions  
- Boost public & active transport (walk, cycle)  
- Electrify two/three-wheelers and buses  
- Use data and simulation for smarter traffic planning

The project includes baseline analysis, emissions estimation, GIS mapping, and traffic simulation—culminating in policy, tech, and behavioral recommendations.

**Tools:** Python, QGIS, SUMO, OpenStreetMap, ML models
