 # 🚗 Sustainable Urban Mobility – Agra

**Project:** Sustainable Mobility Case Study for CAIC Summer of Tech 2025

This project aims to design a tech-driven, low-emission urban mobility strategy for **Agra** by 2030–2040. Agra, a historical city with heavy tourist traffic, faces rising congestion, air pollution, and dependence on two-wheelers and informal transit modes.

### 🔍 Key Goals

- Reduce CO₂ and PM₂.₅ emissions  
- Boost public & active transport (walk, cycle)  
- Electrify two/three-wheelers and buses  
- Use data and simulation for smarter traffic planning
